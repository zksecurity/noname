# Noname

This is **work-in-progress** to implement a high-level (Rust and Golang-inspired) programming language to write zkapps for [kimchi](https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems) or [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs). The supported arithmetic backends are:
 - Kimchi 
 - R1CS

If you don't know what zero-knowledge proofs, zkapps, or kimchi are, check out [that blogpost](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/kimchi-the-latest-update-to-minas-proof-system).

You can read more about the project on the noname book: https://zksecurity.github.io/noname or my [series of blogposts](https://cryptologie.net/#article_573).

I invite you to try to [install](#installation) and [play](#usage) with noname. Please provide feedback and suggestions via the [issues](https://github.com/zksecurity/noname/issues).

## Examples

For example, here's a circuit that has one public input and one private input:

```rust
use std::crypto;

fn main(pub public_input: Field, private_input: [Field; 2]) {
    // checks that they add up to 2
    let x = private_input[0] + private_input[1];
    assert_eq(x, 2);
    
    // checks that one is the hash of the other
    let digest = crypto::poseidon(private_input);
    assert_eq(digest[0], public_input);
}
```

You can compile it with the following command:

```console
$ noname test --path examples/example.no --private-inputs '{"private_input": ["1", "1"]}' --public-inputs '{"public_input": "3654913405619483358804575553468071097765421484960111776885779739261304758583"}' --debug
```

Which will print the assembly, as well as try to create and verify a proof to make sure everything works. The assembly should look like this:

```

If you run the command with `--debug` it should show you what lines created what gates:

and what lines created what wiring:

If you pass an invalid input it should fail with an error:

```
$ noname test --path examples/example.no --private-inputs '{"private_input": ["2", "1"]}' --public-inputs '{"public_input": "3654913405619483358804575553468071097765421484960111776885779739261304758583"}'
```

## Installation

As this is work in progress, you need to install the compiler from source using [cargo](https://rustup.rs/). 
You can do this by running the following command:

```console
$ cargo install --git https://www.github.com/zksecurity/noname
```

## Usage

Simply write `noname` in the console to get access to the CLI:

```console
$ noname
```

To create a project, use `noname new` to create a project in a new directory, or `noname init` to initialize an existing directory. For example:

```
$ noname new --path my_project 
```

This will create a `Noname.toml` manifest file, which contains the name of your project (which must follow a Github `user/repo` format) as well as dependencies you're using (following the same format, as they are retrieved from Github).

This will also create a `src` directory, which contains a `main.no` file, which is the entry point of your program. If you want to create a library, pass the `--lib` flag to the `new` or `init` command of `noname`, and it will create a `lib.no` file instead.

```
$ tree
.
├── Noname.toml
└── src
    └── main.no
```

You can then use the following command to check the correctness of your code (and its dependencies):

```
$ noname check
```

or you can test a full run with:

```
$ noname test
```

which will attempt to create a proof and verify it. See the [examples](#examples) section to see how to use it.

## Current limitations

Currently there are no commands to compile a program and produce the compiled prover and verifier parameters. There is also no command to produce a serializable proof.

It's not hard, it's just hasn't been prioritized.

You can also not use third-party libraries (eventhough the CLI might suggest that it works). I think it's close to be working though.

In general, there's a large number of missing features. I will prioritize what I think needs to be done, but if you have a feature request, please open an [issue](https://github.com/zksecurity/noname/issues).
